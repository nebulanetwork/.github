Nebula Network is a well-established online gaming community that has been active since 2015. The community was founded by Nimoy, who created a modpack centered around the popular YouTube series Minecraft Diaries, which was created by Aphmau. This modpack quickly gained popularity and garnered almost 100,000 downloads. The success of the modpack caught the attention of Aphmau herself, which helped to propel the community even further.  
  
As time passed, the community continued to grow and expand into various other Minecraft modpacks, servers, and other games. Through its dedication to providing quality gaming experiences and fostering a friendly and inclusive environment, Nebula Network managed to attract and retain a large and dedicated player base.

Today, Nebula Network is remains and continues to release modpacks maintained by Carhenia, Nebula Networks second owner and  current Network Manager.
